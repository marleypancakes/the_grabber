# The Grabber

A one-step screenshot tool for capturing background transparency images in Windows, written in Python. It uses OpenCV's [intelligent scissors](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df5/tutorial_js_intelligent_scissors.html) tool for edge detection, allowing users to click along the borders of the image they wish to capture.
Down the road, I plan on linking this with a Telegram bot so captured PNGs can be automatically added to a sticker pack owned by the user, but it can also be used similarly with Discord and other platforms.

This project was created during my batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

This open-source project is in active development and open to contributors.
